World Wide Web is famous service for Mosaic. World Wide Web makes hypertext
over Network.



3. How to use ?

3.1. Basic

plain2 convert foo.txt (plain text) to bar.html (HTML).



3.1.2. convert plain text to HTML with pictures and tables

use -htmlonce and -raw.



3.2. Extended (plain2html)

3.2.1. require

HTML is not support picture and table, you know. but plain2 generate 
image and table via roff or TeX.
Then you need roff or TeX and image processing programs.

For example, this packege include c-shell script which named plain2html.
This script ganerate HTML and picture and table files.
(pictures and tables are GIF format file).
and plain2html require follow programs.

    (1) plain2

    (2) typesetting program
        - TeX
                * latex and dvi2ps
		  ('jlatex' is japanelized latex. please subsitute 
		   'jlatex' to 'latex' in script)
        - roff 
                * groff

    (3) image processing program
        - convert ( which included ImageMagick)
        - pnmcrop ( which included pbmplus)

    (4) other
        - csh or tcsh
        - awk
        - ghostscript ( convert calle it)
        - pt2htcol.awk ( inclued this packege )

3.2.2. How to use

For eample, convert plain text file foo.txt to HTML.

    (1) Make working direcory, because plain2 generate many files.

                % mkdir foo.work
                % cp foo.txt foo.work
                % cd foo.work

    (2) run plain2html

               % plain2html foo.txt

	plain2html gerate HTML file foo.html, PIC*.gif (for picture) and 
	TBL*.gif (for table).

So, you get HTML file.  Please check result via Mosaic or Chimera.

        % Mosaic foo.html

or 

        % chimera foo.html
